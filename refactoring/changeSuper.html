	<h2>Change Superclass</h2>

	<section><h3>Forces of Conflict</h3>
		<p>Consider the situation where you have a class you've written, and would like
		that class to behave nearly-identically to a class in another library. However,
		you can't simply use an instance of that library's class due to small differences
		in what it can do and the contexts in which you need it to operate.</p>

		<p>Or, maybe, there are two classes that exhibit similar behavior and have
		a significant amount of duplicate code.
	</section>

	<section><h3>Resolution</h3>
		<p>In the first example above, changing the class's superclass to the desired
		external library's class would allow you to inherit everything you'd normally
		need from it while making the modifications that keep it functioning in
		the context of your program.</p>

		<p>In the second example, you can consolidate their duplicated methods and
		instance variables into a singular superclass, changing superclass to it. </p>
